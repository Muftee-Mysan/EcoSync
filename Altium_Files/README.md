### Altium PCB Design Files

We have used **Altium Designer** to create the printed circuit board (PCB) designs for our project. The files in this directory include the **schematic** and **PCB layouts** for two specific designs:

1. **AC Controller**
2. **Key Card Presence Detector**

#### Design Details:

- Both PCBs were designed using a **two-layer** approach, with **top** and **bottom** layers.
- During the design process, we referred to the **datasheets** of all the components to ensure accurate specifications and proper functionality.

These designs are crucial for controlling the air conditioning system and detecting key card presence, contributing to energy efficiency and automated room control in our project.
